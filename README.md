# Hangman
Simple hangman game implemented using python

Description  
The Hangman game allows players to guess a word by guessing individual letters. The game provides different categories, including hobbies/interests, countries, animals/birds, and random words.
  
The player selects a category and chooses the difficulty level based on the word length. The player has as many lives as the number of letters in the chosen word. The game ends when the player either loses all the lives or guesses the word correctly.
